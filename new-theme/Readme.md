# ShopBase Starter Theme
Starter Theme is a theme that is specifically structured to be used as a starting point for a new project. Ideally, Starter Theme contains everything you need when producing a theme, including solutions to common problems, 3rd party libraries, and helpful reminders.

This theme represents the opinionated and preferred starting point for the ShopBase Themes Team.
## Installation
